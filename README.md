# react-redux-project

# Overview

This is my submission for the React-Redux Final Project. The application is called "PhotoOps", an app where you create a user, look up all types of images from a search bar, and store the images you like by clicking on the image. This was my attempt to create a React App where you can effectively keep your favorite images stored from my Rails Api.


# Getting Started

To get started, you can fork and clone this repo. After you have forked and cloned this repo, you can head over to your ide and run the following command: git clone (repo you cloned goes here without the parentheses) and then press enter. On the following line you can run the command: cd (name of repo). Once thats done, you can open the project by opening up your favorite text editor. I use Visual Studio Code, so in my case it would be: code . to open the whole project.

Once this is done, you can cd into the backend directory with the command: cd rails-backend. After that, you can run the command: rails s, to start the backend server. Once this is finished you can add in another terminal. From this terminal you have to run: cd react-redux. This will lead you to the front-end directory. Once you are here, you can run the command: npm install. Afterwards, you can run npm start to start the server. It will ask you if you want to host the server on localhost:3001 since the backend rails api is taking over localhost:3000. You would type in: y, and then the front end server will start. From here you can enjoy the application!
